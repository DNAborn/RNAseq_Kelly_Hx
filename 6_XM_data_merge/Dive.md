Follow-up analysis on the annotated master table built in
[Master_Table.Rmd](Master_Table.Rmd) (see [its rendered
output](Readme.md) for how the annotation columns are defined). This
document starts by reducing the table to the genes that are actually
worth looking at. Code blocks are collapsed - click *Code* to expand.

# Input

`master_counts_table.xlsx` carries everything: the DESeq2 contrasts, the
annotation columns, and the per-sample normalized counts. Reading 65 MB
of Excel on every knit is slow, so it is cached as an RDS and only
re-read when the xlsx is newer.

# Reduction

Most of the table is not expressed: 61% of all genes have a
`baseMean_Kelly` of exactly zero. Expression is therefore the primary
filter.

A gene is kept anyway if it has at least 100 publications. That rescue
is there so well-characterised genes stay visible as a reference even
when they are silent in this cell line - TLR2, HFE, NOD2, POSTN and DCN
are all annotated HIF targets that a pure expression cutoff would drop.

Literature coverage is used **only** in that direction: it can keep a
gene in, it never throws one out. A strongly expressed but unstudied
gene is a candidate, not noise, and filtering on publication counts
would preferentially discard exactly those - one Kelly-specific target
sits at `baseMean` 7,235 with no annotation at all. `pubmed_total` and
`pubmed_hypoxia` otherwise stay in the table as a ranking aid.

# Why each gene is in, so the rescued ones can be excluded again downstream
# without recomputing the rule.

**Reduction**

| Step                             | Genes | Share |
|:---------------------------------|------:|:------|
| master_counts_table              | 64537 | 100%  |
| baseMean_Kelly \>= 10            | 18471 | 29%   |
| \+ rescued: pubmed_total \>= 100 | 20462 | 32%   |

The rescue adds 11% to the table. Worth knowing before using it: 617 of
the rescued genes have a `baseMean` of exactly zero, so they enter as
rows of pure zero counts. That is informative as a reference - “this
well-known gene is not expressed in Kelly” - but they should be excluded
from anything that consumes the count columns, which `dive_reason` makes
easy.

**Expression of the 1,991 literature-rescued genes**

| baseMean  | Genes |
|:----------|------:|
| exactly 0 |   617 |
| 0 - 1     |   907 |
| 1 - 10    |   467 |

What survives, by annotation. The reduction removes three quarters of
the rows but keeps the large majority of the annotated candidates, which
is the point:

**Effect of the reduction per annotation set**

| Set                     | before | expressed | rescued | after | kept |
|:------------------------|-------:|----------:|--------:|------:|:-----|
| all genes               |  64537 |     18471 |    1991 | 20462 | 32%  |
| HIF targets             |   1837 |      1311 |      52 |  1363 | 74%  |
| Kelly-specific targets  |    922 |       685 |      32 |   717 | 78%  |
| HR adverse              |   6081 |      4598 |      70 |  4668 | 77%  |
| with hypoxia literature |   7945 |      5911 |    1170 |  7081 | 89%  |

The best-studied HIF targets that a pure expression cutoff would have
dropped - all of them now retained by the rescue:

Still dropped: annotated targets that are both silent and barely
studied. These are the ones the filter is meant to catch.
